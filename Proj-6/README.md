    3) Run Submission/simIRB120_nofriction.m
   
  Part 1(b) For simulating the system response with friction

    1) Open Submission/robotsimulation.slx
    2) Make sure the manual switch is connected to the constant 0 (Upper)
    3) Run Submission/simIRB120.m
  
  Part 3(a) For PID manual Tuning
    
    1) Open Submission/robotsimulation.slx
    2) Make sure the manual switch is connected to the PID controller (Lower)
    3) Adjust other parameters as wish (trial number, etc.)
    4) Run Submission/simIRB120.m
  
  Part 3(c) For Tracking without gravity compensation
    
    1) Open Submission/robotwithqdes.slx
