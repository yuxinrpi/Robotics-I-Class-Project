Instruction:  
  For plotting the poses of singularities
  
    1) Run singularity.m
    
  For Inverse Kinematics Solver using Jacobian
    
    1) If you want to test the function using 50 random poses,
      -> set mode = 1 at Line 8
      -> Run the code
    2) If you want to compute the joint projectories along the S letter curve on sphere
      -> set mode = 2 at Line 8
      -> Run the code
  
  For Plotting Singular Values along path length
  
    1) Run /Proj3-Singular/Proj3.m
